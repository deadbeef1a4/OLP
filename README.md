# Open Lists Project (OLP)

The Open Lists Project aims to curate complete, up-to-date, easy to use lists pertaining to any topic imaginable. The main author of this project is @deadbeef1a4. You can find them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deadbeef1a4) or buy them a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/deadbeef1a4)!

## Usage

Lists are stored as plain text files with Unix-style line endings (`\n`) and are grouped into directories (and subdirectories if necessary) according to their subject matter. We try to keep the directory structure as flat as possible while also keeping the number of lists per directory to a reasonable number. Please note that inclusion or omission of an item in a list is never intended as political commentary on the subject matter. (Un)fortunately, the real world does not always fit neatly into precise categories. In these instances, we adhere to the most broadly-accepted definitions set forth by the relevant authorities, if possible. For example, the list of countries is comprised of sovereign states with either full membership or observer status at the United Nations. Addition or removal of list members is always welcome, provided there is sufficient rationale stated for the change. Most often, this will probably be tiedto some sort of recent event -- a newly-discovered element, or a country that has gained widely-recognized independance, for example. Lists are organized by the most sensible criterion given the subject matter (chronologically, alphabetically, numerically...)
