# OLP (Open Lists Project)

The Open Lists Project aims to curate complete, up-to-date, easy to use lists pertaining to any topic imaginable. 

## Organization

* politics/
  * presidents/
    * US/
* geography/
  * states/
    * US/

## Usage

Find the file with the list you need -- they are organized into (hopefully) logically-named directories to make traversal easier. Lists are stored as plain text files with Unix-style line endings (`\n\r`).

---**This is not implemented yet**---
Files can be converted to different formats as required, including JSON, XML, and CSV. To do this, simply run the corresponding shell script found in the root directory with the full path of the filename as the argument.
